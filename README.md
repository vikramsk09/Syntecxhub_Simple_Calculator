🧮 Simple Python Calculator

A command-line based calculator built using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, type conversion, and basic error handling.

🚀 Features:
1) Perform basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

2) Handles division by zero errors
3) Rounds multiplication and division results to 2 decimal places
4) Continuous calculation using a loop
5) Option to exit anytime
6) Basic exception handling for undefined results

🛠 Technologies Used:
1) Python 3
2) Built-in modules (math)

📂 How to Run the Project

A. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo-name

B. Run the script:
python calculator.py
📸 Example Usage
Press 'e' to exit or 'enter' to continue:

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the operation you wish to perform (+,-,*,/): *
Enter the second number: 5

10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0

🧠 Concepts Practiced:
- while loops
- if-elif-else statements
- User input handling
- Type conversion (float)
- Exception handling (try-except)
- Basic program flow control

📌 Future Improvements:
1) Add support for advanced operations (power, square root, modulus)
2) Improve input validation
3) Convert into GUI version
4) Add history feature
5) Refactor into function-based structure
